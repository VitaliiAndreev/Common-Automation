# Common-Automation

Shared, tech-agnostic GitHub Actions composite actions and reusable workflows.

Lives outside any single language ecosystem so it can be consumed by
PowerShell, .NET, and future stacks without dragging tooling along.

## Actions

**Linting & validation**

| Action                                          | Purpose                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.github/actions/shellcheck-bash/`              | Runs strict shellcheck on every *.sh under a given directory.     |
| `.github/actions/actionlint/`                   | Lints GitHub Actions workflows and composite actions via pinned rhysd/actionlint. |
| `.github/actions/action-validator/`             | Schema-validates workflows and composite `action.yml` files via pinned mpalmer/action-validator. |

| `.github/actions/ansible-lint/`                 | Lints Ansible content (playbooks, roles, ansible.cfg) via pinned ansible-lint; auto-skips when none of those exist. |

**Test infrastructure**

| Action                                          | Purpose                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.github/actions/test-bats/`                    | Installs bats-core and runs every *.bats suite under a given path. |
| `.github/actions/build-ssh-test-image/`         | Builds the SSH target Docker image used by integration tests.     |

**CI utilities**

| Action                                          | Purpose                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `.github/actions/check-sh-executable/`          | Fails a job when any tracked `*.sh` is missing the executable bit. |
| `.github/actions/retry/`                        | Wraps an arbitrary bash command in the [retry primitive](#retry-primitive) with default transient classifiers. |

**Release**

| Action                                          | Purpose                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.github/actions/create-github-release/`        | Creates a GitHub Release for a tag, body taken from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section (Keep a Changelog). Stack-agnostic - any artifact stream (PowerShell module, NuGet, ...) reuses it; fails if the version has no changelog section. |

## Retry primitive

`.github/lib/retry.sh` is a sourced helper that wraps any command in
a bounded retry loop, so callers (including the dockerised lint
actions in this repo) don't reimplement the same `until ... sleep ...`
pattern when a transient failure - Docker registry timeout, DNS
blip, HTTP 5xx - flakes a CI run. It lives alongside the other
production sourced helpers (`fix-sh-executable.sh`,
`get-*-version.sh`).

Signature:

```bash
# shellcheck source=.github/lib/retry.sh
source "${REPO_ROOT}/.github/lib/retry.sh"
retry_command "docker build" -- docker build -t foo .
```

The first argument is an operation name used in diagnostics. `--`
separates it from the command vector so the wrapped command can
carry arbitrary flags.

Configuration env vars (defaults shown):

| Env var               | Default | Meaning                                              |
|-----------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`  | `5`     | Hard cap on attempts including the first try.        |
| `RETRY_MAX_SECONDS`   | `300`   | Wall-clock budget across all attempts.               |

Between attempts the primitive calls a **backoff strategy** to
compute the sleep duration. The strategy is a shell function whose
name is held in `RETRY_BACKOFF_STRATEGY`; the primitive itself only
calls it and caps the returned value to the remaining wall-clock
budget. This indirection means a future caller needing a different
shape (constant / linear / decorrelated jitter) registers a function
and points the env var at it - no edits to the primitive.

Strategy contract:

| `$1`  | Retry index (1 for the first retry after attempt 1 fails). |
| `$2`  | Remaining wall-clock budget in seconds (advisory).         |
| stdout | Sleep duration in seconds (decimals allowed).             |
| exit  | 0 on success; non-zero is a usage error.                   |

The primitive caps the returned value to `$2` automatically, so a
strategy can't sleep past the deadline by accident.

The shipped default is `exponential_jitter_backoff`, which lives
in its own file at
`.github/lib/retry-strategies/exponential-jitter.sh` and is sourced
automatically when `retry.sh` is loaded. The file doubles as the
worked example for consumers writing their own strategies. The
function follows the AWS SDK and Google SRE-book baseline: for
retry index `R`, the unjittered interval is
`min(INITIAL * MULTIPLIER^(R-1), MAX)`; jitter then multiplies by
`1 + uniform(-RATIO, +RATIO)`. Its knobs:

| Env var                          | Default | Meaning                                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `RETRY_BACKOFF_INITIAL_SECONDS`  | `2`     | Base sleep after the first failed attempt.               |
| `RETRY_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS`      | `60`    | Cap on the unjittered sleep, applied before jitter.      |
| `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`       | `2`     | Growth factor per retry index.                           |
| `RETRY_BACKOFF_JITTER_RATIO`     | `0.3`   | Symmetric jitter band (`0.3` = +/-30%). `0` disables.    |

Registering a custom strategy:

```bash
# In a file sourced before retry_command runs:
my_constant_backoff() {
    # $1 = retry index, $2 = remaining seconds (ignored here).
    echo "5.000"
}
export -f my_constant_backoff
export RETRY_BACKOFF_STRATEGY=my_constant_backoff
```

Between the failed attempt and the backoff sleep, the primitive runs
**classifiers** to decide whether the failure is worth retrying at
all. A classifier is a shell function named `<name>_classify`
listed in `RETRY_CLASSIFIERS` (colon-separated). Each is invoked with
the failed attempt's exit code, the path to its captured stdout, and
the path to its captured stderr; it returns 0 to mark the failure
retriable and non-zero to mark it permanent. Default is an empty
list, which preserves the always-retry behaviour described above -
opt in to triage by setting the env var.

Classifier contract:

| `$1`   | Exit code from the failed attempt.                       |
| `$2`   | Path to a file containing the attempt's stdout.          |
| `$3`   | Path to a file containing the attempt's stderr.          |
| exit 0 | Failure is retriable.                                    |
| exit !0 | Failure is permanent (its stderr is surfaced verbatim). |

Multiple classifiers OR: any accept triggers a retry; all reject
makes the primitive return the failed exit code immediately, naming
the last rejector and its stderr in the `retry:` diagnostic so the
reason is visible without re-running. While classifiers are active,
the wrapped command's stdout / stderr are tee'd to capture files for
inspection AND still forwarded to the caller's fds in real time - no
swallowing.

Three default classifiers ship out of the box, each living in its
own file under `.github/lib/retry-classifiers/` and sourced
automatically when `retry.sh` is loaded. All three match
case-insensitively against the captured stdout *and* stderr - which
fd carries the error varies by tool, so scanning both keeps the
classifier from missing real transients.

| Classifier                  | Patterns it accepts as retriable                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `classify_docker_registry`  | `dial tcp .*: i/o timeout`, `dial tcp .*: connection refused`, `failed to do request: Head .* dial tcp`, `received unexpected HTTP status: 5[0-9][0-9]`, `TLS handshake timeout`, `unexpected EOF`, `context deadline exceeded`.   |
| `classify_network`          | `Temporary failure in name resolution`, `Could not resolve host`, `Connection timed out`, `Connection reset by peer`, `Network is unreachable`.                                                                                    |
| `classify_http_5xx`         | `HTTP/<version> 5[0-9][0-9]`, `Server Error: 5[0-9][0-9]`. 4xx is deliberately not matched - those are permanent for the caller (RFC 9110 section 15.6).                                                                            |

Recommended default for dockerised actions (the value the composite
action in step 5 ships with):

```bash
export RETRY_CLASSIFIERS=classify_docker_registry:classify_network:classify_http_5xx
```

The four in-repo lint actions (ansible-lint, yamllint, actionlint,
action-validator) adopt this default in steps 6-9.

Output is passthrough: the wrapped command's stdout / stderr reach
the caller verbatim. Only the primitive's own messages carry the
`retry:` prefix, and they always go to stderr.

### Composite action

For workflows that prefer a YAML target over sourcing the primitive
in a `run:` block, `.github/actions/retry/` is a thin pass-through
exposing three inputs (`command`, `max_attempts`, `transient_patterns`).
The defaults match the recommended dockerised-action set above. See
[`.github/actions/retry/README.md`](.github/actions/retry/README.md)
for the input contract and worked example. One-line usage:

```yaml
- uses: Klark-Morrigan/Common-Automation/.github/actions/retry@v1
  with:
    command: docker build -t example:ci .
```



Production bash (composite-action logic) is extracted into `*.sh`
files alongside each action and unit-tested with
[bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core). Static analysis
is `shellcheck` at its strictest setting (`--severity=style
--enable=all`).

Runner bash (maintainer-side dev scripts) lives under `scripts/` and
shares the same lint bar.

### One-time setup after clone

```bash
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

Wires the repo-checked-in pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`),
which auto-fixes the executable bit on `.sh` files. Without this
step, files authored on Windows commit as mode 0644 and CI catches
them later - the hook just turns "push, fail, fix, re-push" into
"commit silently succeeds."

### Running checks and tests locally

```bash
./scripts/run-ci-yaml-and-bash.sh
```

`scripts/run-ci-yaml-and-bash.sh` is the orchestrator: the single
"run everything locally" entry point. It runs both the lint half and
the test half against the target repo and reports a combined
pass/fail. It is the local equivalent of the `ci-yaml.yml` +
`ci-bash.yml` workflows, so a green run here means CI should pass too.
Run it before pushing to catch failures locally. Windows users can
double-click `scripts/run-ci-yaml-and-bash.bat` for the same result.

The work is split across three `_`-prefixed building blocks the
orchestrator sources and runs; the underscore marks them as internal
to the runner set rather than entry points. Each can also be invoked
in isolation when you only care about one half:

- `scripts/_run-common.sh` - shared setup: resolves the target repo
  and arms the hold-window pause on double-click exit. Sourced by the
  three entry scripts below rather than run directly.
- `scripts/_run-lint-yaml-and-bash.sh` - the lint half. Runs
  `shellcheck` (production `.github`, runner `scripts/`, git hooks),
  `check-sh-executable`, `actionlint`, `action-validator`, `yamllint`,
  and `ansible-lint`. Each check auto-skips when its surface is absent,
  so a repo with only some of these still passes cleanly. Docker is
  required for the dockerised linters.
- `scripts/_run-tests-bash.sh` - the test half. Runs every `*.bats`
  suite via native `bats` if installed, otherwise the pinned Docker
  image (`bats/bats:1.11.0`, the same image CI uses).

All three honour `COMMON_AUTOMATION_TARGET_REPO`, which points them at
a repo other than this one. That is how consuming repos run the same
lint + bats recipe against themselves: they ship thin shims of the
same names that set the variable and delegate here, so the runner
logic lives in one place.

## Consuming

### Atomic actions

Reference any action directly from another repo's workflow:

```yaml
- uses: Klark-Morrigan/Common-Automation/.github/actions/assert-secret@v1
  with:
    value: ${{ secrets.PSGALLERY_API_KEY }}
    name: PSGALLERY_API_KEY
```

### Reusable workflow: ci-bash

For repos that want the same lint + bats recipe applied to their own
bash, call the `ci-bash.yml` reusable workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  bash:
    uses: Klark-Morrigan/Common-Automation/.github/workflows/ci-bash.yml@v1
```

No inputs needed by default - the workflow scans the caller's
`.github/actions/` (production) and `scripts/` (runner) directories.
Missing directories are skipped silently, so a repo that has only one
or the other still works without configuration.

Override `bats-version` if you need to pin to a specific bats release.

### Reusable workflow: ci-yaml

For the same lint recipe applied to a repo's GitHub Actions YAML
(workflows + composite `action.yml` files), call the `ci-yaml.yml`
reusable workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  yaml:
    uses: Klark-Morrigan/Common-Automation/.github/workflows/ci-yaml.yml@v1
```

No inputs - all four underlying composite actions self-resolve
their pinned versions. The workflow runs `actionlint`,
`action-validator`, `yamllint`, and `ansible-lint` as parallel
jobs. Each underlying surface may be absent: actionlint and
action-validator skip silently when `.github/workflows/` or
`.github/actions/` is empty; yamllint skips when no plain YAML
exists outside those trees; ansible-lint skips when none of
`ansible.cfg`, `playbooks/`, `roles/` exist at the repo root.
That auto-skip is what lets a single reusable workflow serve
every consumer without per-repo configuration.

### Pinning

Use `@v1` for the stable tag once published; pin to `@master` during
iteration, or to a SHA for maximum reproducibility.
